Act as a senior ATS resume optimizer and technical recruiter specialized in Machine Learning Engineer / AI Engineer roles. Your objective is to maximize ATS compatibility (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS) while keeping the resume truthful, defensible, and recruiter-readable. Target ATS score: 95–100.

=====================================================
🔵 ATS SCORING MODEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
=====================================================
You must internally simulate a modern ATS scoring system (Workday / Greenhouse style):

Scoring dimensions:
- Keyword Presence (40%)
- Keyword Frequency & Redundancy (20%)
- Keyword Placement Priority (20%)
- Semantic Similarity to JD (10%)
- Role Title Alignment (10%)

A resume scoring below 95% in this model is considered a FAILURE and must be rewritten.

=====================================================
🔵 KEYWORD PRIORITY TIERS (MANDATORY)
=====================================================
Classify extracted JD keywords into:

TIER 1 — MUST-HAVE CORE SIGNALS
(e.g., LLMs, intelligent search, ranking, retrieval, vector databases, production ML)

TIER 2 — STRONG DIFFERENTIATORS
(e.g., feedback loops, multi-step reasoning, real-time systems, scalability)

TIER 3 — SUPPORTING SIGNALS
(e.g., tools, frameworks, monitoring, CI/CD)

Rules:
- 100% of TIER 1 keywords MUST appear ≥3 times across sections
- ≥90% of TIER 2 keywords MUST appear ≥2 times
- ≥70% of TIER 3 keywords MUST appear ≥1 time

=====================================================
🔵 KEYWORD PLACEMENT PRIORITY (CRITICAL)
=====================================================
For every TIER 1 keyword:
- Must appear in Summary OR Skills
- Must appear in Projects

Failure to place a TIER 1 keyword in both zones is unacceptable.

=====================================================
🔵 KEYWORD PROXIMITY ENFORCEMENT
=====================================================
When injecting keywords, cluster them logically:
- LLMs + retrieval + ranking
- real-time + low-latency + production inference
- feedback loops + evaluation + optimization

Avoid scattering keywords randomly.
Prefer dense, semantically related groupings within the same bullet.

=====================================================
🔵 GENERIC BULLET DETECTION (FAILURE MODE)
=====================================================
Before outputting, evaluate every bullet:

If a bullet could apply to a generic ML Engineer at Google/Amazon/Meta,
it MUST be rewritten.

Bullets must explicitly signal:
- Company domain
- Product workflow
- User intent
- System behavior under constraints

=====================================================
INPUTS
=====================================================
1) My base resume content is provided in the BASE SECTIONS below (do NOT assume anything else).
2) A specific Job Description (JD) is provided at the very end.

=====================================================
TASK SCOPE (STRICT)
=====================================================
You must generate ONLY the following 3 LaTeX section blocks (patches):
1) Summary (exactly 3 lines)
2) Skills
4) Projects

❌ Do NOT output explanations  
❌ Do NOT output analysis  
❌ Do NOT output any other LaTeX (no header, no \section{...}, no Education, no Certifications, no \begin{document})

=====================================================
🔵 WORD COUNT IMMUTABILITY CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)
=====================================================
Scope:
- Summary → exact same total word count as base Summary text (words only; ignore LaTeX commands).
- Each Project bullet → 12–13 words per bullet.

=====================================================
🔵 ATS KEYWORD COVERAGE ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY)
=====================================================
STEP 1 — JD KEYWORD EXTRACTION
From the JD, extract all ATS-relevant keywords, including:
- Programming languages
- ML/DL models & tasks
- LLM, GenAI, agentic system terminology
- Evaluation methods
- Infrastructure & MLOps tools
- System properties (real-time, scalable, production, distributed)
- Domain keywords (e.g., trust & safety, content moderation, multimodal)

Normalize keywords to canonical ATS forms (e.g., “Large Language Models” → “LLMs”, “human in loop” → “human-in-the-loop”).

=====================================================
🔵 JD PHRASE MIRRORING
=====================================================
Reuse exact noun phrases from the JD wherever possible.
Prefer verbatim JD phrasing over paraphrasing.

STEP 2 — KEYWORD COVERAGE AUDIT
Compare extracted JD keywords against:
- Summary
- Skills
- Projects

Create an internal checklist:
- Covered ✅
- Missing ❌

STEP 3 — FORCED KEYWORD INJECTION
For every missing high-priority keyword, you MUST inject it verbatim into at least one of:
- Skills (preferred)
- Summary
- Project bullets

Rules:
- Keywords MUST appear exactly as in the JD (except canonical normalization noted above).
- You MAY add multiple keywords per bullet.
- You MAY lightly restructure bullets if required.
- Coverage overrides elegance.

STEP 4 — DENSITY THRESHOLD (CRITICAL)
Ensure:
- ≥90% of JD keywords appear at least once
- ≥70% appear two or more times across sections

If a keyword is unused, force-inject it into Skills or Summary.

STEP 5 — FINAL ATS VALIDATION PASS
Before outputting:
- Re-scan the generated sections
- Confirm no important JD keyword is missing
- Do NOT output until coverage is satisfied

=====================================================
SECTION 1 — SUMMARY RULES (UPDATED — TITLE NORMALIZATION)
=====================================================

- Start exactly with: “MS in Computer Science at UIC”
- Mirror JD wording aggressively
- Explicitly mention: end-to-end ML/GenAI lifecycle, production/real-world systems, JD domain focus
- Exactly 3 lines (keep it readable as 3 line-broken sentences inside LaTeX)
- Word count must match the base Summary word count (words only; ignore LaTeX tokens)

-----------------------------------------------------
ROLE TITLE NORMALIZATION (CRITICAL — ATS-SAFE)
-----------------------------------------------------
When writing the final line ending with “Seeking … role.”:

- DO NOT use seniority levels, numerals, or modifiers from the JD
- Normalize the title to a **standard ATS-recognized role name**

Normalization rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

- “Junior Data Engineer”, “Associate Data Engineer”, “Data Engineer I”
  → **Data Engineer**

- “ML Engineer II”, “ML Engineer III”, “Senior ML Engineer”
  → **Machine Learning Engineer**

- “AI Engineer”, “Applied AI Engineer”
  → **AI Engineer**

- “Applied Scientist”, “Research Scientist”
  → **Machine Learning Engineer** (unless JD is explicitly research-only)

- “Software Engineer – ML”, “SWE ML”
  → **Machine Learning Engineer**

Rules:
- Use ONLY the normalized title in the Summary
- Do NOT include levels (Junior, Senior, I/II/III, Lead, Staff)
- Do NOT include team-specific or internal company titles
- Title must be clean, canonical, and ATS-standard

Failure to normalize the role title → HARD FAILURE.


=====================================================
SECTION 2 — SKILLS RULES (UPDATED — TEMPLATE-SAFE)
=====================================================

GENERAL RULES
- Keep category names unchanged
- Preserve existing formatting and indentation
- Do NOT alter LaTeX structure, spacing commands, or line breaks
- Do NOT include the \section{Skills} header (it is already in the template)
- Do NOT remove high-signal or JD-critical skills
- Add all missing JD tools / technologies / keywords
- ❌ No soft skills
- ❌ No vague buzzwords
- Use ATS-standard canonical naming

-----------------------------------------------------
SINGLE-LINE LAYOUT CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)
-----------------------------------------------------
Each skill category MUST remain on a single visual line
without altering the resume template.

Rules:
- No additional line breaks
- No forced wrapping
- No font-size, spacing, or margin changes
- If content risks wrapping, adjust skill selection instead

-----------------------------------------------------
WORD COUNT CONSTRAINT PER LINE (MANDATORY)
-----------------------------------------------------
Each skill category line MUST contain:

- **Minimum: 10 words**
- **Maximum: 11 words**

Rules:
- Word count includes category label words
- Comma-separated items count as individual words
- Hyphenated terms count as ONE word
- Exceeding this range is a HARD FAILURE

-----------------------------------------------------
SAFE DYNAMIC PRUNING LOGIC (NEW)
-----------------------------------------------------
If adding JD-required keywords risks:
- line overflow OR
- exceeding the 10–11 word limit

You MUST prune ONLY low-impact items while preserving layout.

PRUNING PRIORITY (SAFE ORDER):

1) Remove visually long but low-ATS-impact terms
   (e.g., admin roles, UI tools, generic process phrases)

2) Consolidate implied skills
   (e.g., keep “ETL Pipelines” → remove “Data Ingestion”)

3) Prefer compact, high-signal keywords over verbose phrases
   (e.g., “Model Deployment” over “Production ML Systems”)

FORBIDDEN:
- Removing JD TIER 1 keywords
- Removing exact JD noun phrases
- Altering category titles or punctuation

-----------------------------------------------------
KEYWORD REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE
-----------------------------------------------------
Whenever a skill is removed:
- It MUST be replaced with an equal or higher ATS-value JD keyword
- Net keyword relevance must strictly increase
- Never delete without substitution

-----------------------------------------------------
FINAL TEMPLATE VALIDATION (MANDATORY)
-----------------------------------------------------
Before outputting Skills:

- Verify no category wraps to a second line
- Verify each line contains exactly 10–11 words
- Verify resume formatting is unchanged
- Verify ATS keyword coverage is preserved or improved

If formatting deviates from the base template → REWRITE.

-----------------------------------------------------
CHARACTER LENGTH CONSTRAINT (HARD)
-----------------------------------------------------
Each skill category line MUST NOT exceed:

- Maximum: 130 characters (including spaces and punctuation)

Rules:
- Character count includes category label
- Exceeding 130 characters is a HARD FAILURE
- If risk of overflow exists, prune or replace skills
- Prefer shorter canonical keywords over verbose equivalents


-----------------------------------------------------
SELF-VALIDATION CHECK (REQUIRED)
-----------------------------------------------------
Before outputting the Skills section, you MUST:

1. Count words per line (must be 12–15)
2. Count characters per line (must be ≤130)
3. Visually simulate LaTeX wrapping
4. If ANY line risks wrapping:
   - Prune low-impact skills
   - Replace with shorter JD keywords
   - Revalidate again

If constraints are not met → DO NOT OUTPUT.
Rewrite until compliant.


Output ONLY the Skills section.
No explanations.
No commentary.
No markdown.


=====================================================
SECTION 4 — PROJECTS RULES
=====================================================
🔵 JD-DOMINANT PROJECT REWRITE OVERRIDE (FINAL)
ABSOLUTE OBJECTIVE

Project bullets must read as if they were designed to satisfy this specific JD and company,
with the original project serving only as technical proof.

=====================================================
🔵 JD-ALIGNED PROJECT GENERATION (NEW — MANDATORY)
=====================================================

OBJECTIVE
You must GENERATE exactly **3 new technical projects** that are:
- Fully aligned with the Job Description
- Realistic, defensible, and recruiter-believable
- Written as if implemented by a strong MS CS Machine Learning Engineer
- Optimized for ATS (Workday / Greenhouse / Lever / iCIMS)

These projects REPLACE the original Projects section.
Do NOT reuse the base resume projects.

=====================================================
🔵 PROJECT SELECTION STRATEGY (INTERNAL)
=====================================================

Derive projects directly from:
1) Core problem the company is solving
2) Role responsibilities
3) ML system constraints mentioned in the JD

Each project must map to a **distinct JD competency**:
- Project 1 → Core ML / Modeling / Learning Objective
- Project 2 → Systems / Scaling / Production ML
- Project 3 → Evaluation / Optimization / Real-world Constraints

Avoid academic or toy framing.

=====================================================
🔵 SEMANTIC PROJECT NAMING ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL)
=====================================================

The <SystemName> MUST be semantically derived from the project’s core function.

Rules:
- The name must be clearly traceable to what the system does
- It must be understandable without external explanation
- It must NOT be a generic codename or abstract metaphor

Acceptable derivation patterns:
- Functional derivation (e.g., Pretrain → Pretrainix)
- System role derivation (e.g., Orchestrate → Orchestrix)
- Task abstraction (e.g., Evaluate → Evalon)
- Common engineering naming conventions (-er, -or, -ix, -net, -sys)

FORBIDDEN naming styles:
- Mythological names (Atlas, Helios, Apollo)
- Security metaphors (Sentinel, Guardian)
- Vague power terms (Nova, Quantum, Ultra)
- Arbitrary codenames unrelated to function

Validation test:
If asked “What does <SystemName> do?”  
The answer MUST be obvious from the name itself.

If the name fails this test → HARD FAILURE.
Rewrite the project name until semantically aligned.


=====================================================
🔵 PROJECT STACK DECLARATION (MANDATORY)
=====================================================

Each generated project MUST include a dedicated stack line
immediately below the project title.

FORMAT (REQUIRED):
\textbf{<Project Name>: <Descriptor>} $|$ \textit{<Stack>} \\
\vspace{-0.45cm}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, topsep=0pt, itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt]

Rules:
- Use the pipe symbol `$|$` to separate Title and Stack.
- Keep it on ONE line if possible.
- Stack MUST include only tools already present in Skills or JD
- Stack MUST reflect tools actually used in the project bullets
- Do NOT invent exotic or proprietary tools
- Prefer concrete systems (PyTorch, CUDA, Ray, Kubernetes, Spark, MLflow)

If a project is missing a stack line → HARD FAILURE.

=====================================================
🔵 JD ROLE MODE CLASSIFICATION (PROJECTS ONLY — MANDATORY)
=====================================================

Before generating Projects, you MUST classify the Job Description into
EXACTLY ONE primary role mode:

Choose ONE:
- Research ML / Research Engineer
- Production ML Engineer / Applied Scientist
- ML Infrastructure / Systems
- Safety, Evaluation, or Reliability ML
- Product-Facing ML (ranking, search, recommendations)
- Multimodal / Vision / Speech / Robotics

Rules:
- Use responsibilities, not title keywords
- If ambiguous, choose the mode that dominates evaluation criteria
- This classification MUST influence project framing, bullets, metrics, and vocabulary

If the wrong role mode is selected → PROJECTS SECTION IS INVALID.

=====================================================
🔵 PROJECT BULLET STRUCTURE (JD-ADAPTIVE — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

-----------------------------------------------------
HARD FAILURE CONDITIONS
-----------------------------------------------------

- If the same project bullet structure could fit multiple role modes
- If bullets read as generic ML engineering statements
- If metrics lack baseline or experimental context
- If CRUD-style bullets are used for Research roles

=====================================================
🔵 WORD COUNT CONSTRAINT (CRITICAL)
=====================================================

- Each project bullet MUST be **12–18 words**
- Hard failure if violated

=====================================================

=====================================================

Before outputting, internally verify:
- Project could plausibly be discussed in a technical interview
- Metrics are realistic, not inflated
- Tooling aligns with Skills section
- No claims contradict base resume background

If a project feels fabricated or exaggerated → rewrite.

=====================================================
🔵 JD-ADAPTIVE PROJECT FRAMING (UNIVERSAL)
=====================================================

You must FIRST classify the Job Description into one or more of the following categories:

- Research ML / Research Engineer
- Production ML Engineer / Applied Scientist
- ML Infrastructure / Systems
- Safety, Evaluation, or Reliability ML
- Product-Facing ML (ranking, search, recommendations)
- Multimodal / Vision / Speech / Robotics

This classification MUST influence:
- Project framing
- Vocabulary
- Metrics
- System scope

=====================================================
🔵 PROJECT FRAMING BY JD TYPE (MANDATORY)
=====================================================

If JD is Research-oriented:

=====================================================
🔵 RESEARCH-QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (GLOBAL)
=====================================================

Regardless of JD type, every generated project MUST:
- Investigate a technical question
- Compare at least two approaches, variants, or baselines
- Surface a measurable tradeoff or insight

At least ONE bullet per project MUST reference:
- an ablation
- a comparison
- or an experimental evaluation

=====================================================
🔵 PLAUSIBILITY & SCALE GUARDRAILS (GLOBAL)
=====================================================

Projects MUST reflect the scope of:
- an MS-level or early-career ML/Research Engineer

FORBIDDEN unless explicitly justified:
- Claims implying access to hyperscale proprietary infrastructure
- “Thousands of GPUs”, “internet-scale production”, “global deployment”

PREFERRED phrasing:
- “large-scale datasets”
- “multi-node distributed training”
- “research-scale production systems”
- “pretraining-scale workloads”

Metrics MUST:
- be realistic
- be framed as experimental or project-level improvements

- “improved performance”

If experimental context is missing → REWRITE the bullet.

=====================================================
🔵 EVALUATION METRIC CANONICALIZATION (MANDATORY)
=====================================================

When generating evaluation-related projects, metrics MUST be grounded in
recognized, defensible evaluation signals.

FORBIDDEN vague terms:
- “evaluation accuracy”

- “human preferences” (without definition)

REQUIRED alternatives (choose at least one):
- agreement with human preference labels
- win-rate against baseline model
- reward-model score deltas
- robustness under distribution shifts

If evaluation terminology is vague → REWRITE until concrete.

=====================================================
🔵 INTERVIEW DEFENSIBILITY CHECK (FINAL)
=====================================================

Before outputting each project, internally simulate:
- A deep technical interview for the JD type

If the project cannot be defended with:
- system architecture explanation
